This blog was hosted on Wix until a couple of days ago, where I learned that I could just fork a repo in Github and make a <subdomain>.github.io page.  
 So I've forked over the Jekyll repo, then deleted it and forked over a Jekyll theme repo.  
 Today I edited it a bit to include my hackthebox profile.  
 This took finding a good-enough icon on font-awesome, editing it into the yaml config under a new site.<site_profile> link, and editing the CSS to also reflect this.  
 Also of note, I changed the colors slightly from the original theme, and added some old content to this blog to get some practice.  
 Next up will be practicing markdown to smooth out some sort of workflow for documenting via this blog.
