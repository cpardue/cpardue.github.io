I've been looking very seriously at the tools at my disposal for building myself up to tackle the OSCP.  
I have been in IT for 2 years now, have grown much more than I expected to in this timeframe.  
However, I do not believe that I have enough rote knowledge to off-set the minimum # hours free in the evenings for OSCP, yet.  
I have also been looking very seriously at whether or not I should postpone all Infosec certs to get the new CCNA.  
I have decided to move forward for now with OSCP prep, considering CCNA as an inferior option.  

Previous targets:  
1. Attain better Certs (OSCP I'm looking at you)  
2. Build a BETTER homelab (nice Xmas project)  
3. Code a Project (in Python)
4. Get into Bug Bounty (link profile to Blog)  
5. Get a Domain Name  
6. Contribute to a Github project  
7. Get to 1 Meetup per Month

Previous plan:  
A. Finishing Tryhackme's Advent of Cyber event (Done, no OSCP voucher won)  
B. Build out a more complete Homelab SOC (In Progress)  
C. Start working toward Bug Bounty and local Infosec Meetups (In Progress)  
D. Focus time toward Python (In Progress)  

Revised plan:  
While doing HTB on the weekends,  {  
While looking for monthly meetups{  
While working on automating scanning processes with Python{  
A. Complete TCM Academy Practical Ethical Hacker course (In Progress)  
B. Complete INE eJPT course, earn cert  
C. Complete ItProTv Comptia Pentest+ course  
D. Revise plan again with INE ePTP->OSCP in mind
