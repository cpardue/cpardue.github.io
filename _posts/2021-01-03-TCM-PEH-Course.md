I wasn't sure what to do to further myself after finishing the TryHackme Advent of Cyber course, which ended Dec 25th, 2020.  
I took a couple weeks off to absorb the info I've gained, and think about the next direction forward.  
What I have realized, is that I have many avenues at my disposal.  
My options: 
  eJPT study and test-out
  CCNA study and test-out
  Python courses
  CySA+ study and test-out
  TCM Academy PEH study
  
I've decided that since the TCM PEH course typically costs money, and I got access for free, and I will put it off until I forget about it otherwise...
I better knock it out lest I forget and inevitably delay forever.  

I'll dump my notes here, and use it as a lunchpad for re-building my homelab, 
using what I learned studying for CySA to also monitor the blue side of the attacks I practice in the course.  
The current tentative plan is: 
TCM PEH -> Python -> eJPT||CCNA -> eJPT||CCNA -> ??? -> OSCP  
Wishing my future self luck in this next endeavor.
