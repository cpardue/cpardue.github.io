Since 2015, I have been gathering information from various sources on what exactly I could do with my life, and how exactly I might succeed in doing it.  
I decided to get into Digital Security, ie. Cyber Security, Infosec.  It appears to mesh well with my personal assets and liabilities as a human being.  

So I have gleaned some suggestions over the years which stick out in my mind from two sources:  
Source A - Joseph McCray  
Source B - Daniel Miessler  

Source A, in a number of podcasts and talks, has provided the following nudges and below is my progress thus far:  
Get some certs - Incomplete (net+, sec+, ceh, still need more/better certs)  
Build a homelab - Incomplete (needs more VM and more SIEM)  
Build a Snort box - Done  
Learn a Language - Incomplete (know basic C++ but need to KNOW Python)  
Build a blog - Incomplete (built, needs Domain and integrations)  
Get involved in the Community - Pending  
Contribute to Projects - Pending  

Source B, in a blog, has provided a similar list and below is my progress thus far:  
Education - Incomplete (need to finish a cybersec degree)  
Building Your Lab - Incomplete (but Firewall Done)  
You Are Your Projects - Pending  
Practicing with Bounties - Pending  
Have a Presence - Incomplete (built, needs Domain name and integrations)  
On Certifications - Incomplete (still need more/better certs)  
Making Contributions - Pending  
Networking With Others - Pending  
Conferences - Pending  

And thus, the list hath been generated.  The things I need to work on, according to these two lists, are as follows:  
1. Attain better Certs (OSCP I'm looking at you)  
2. Build a BETTER homelab (nice Xmas project)  
3. Code a Project (in Python)  
4. Get into Bug Bounty (link profile to Blog)  
5. Get a Domain Name  
6. Contribute to a Github project  
7. Get to 1 Meetup per Month

What I'm doing next:  
A. Finishing Tryhackme's Advent of Cyber event (C'mon OSCP Voucher!!)  
B. Build out a more complete Homelab SOC  
C. Start working toward Bug Bounty and local Infosec Meetups  
D. Focus time toward Python
