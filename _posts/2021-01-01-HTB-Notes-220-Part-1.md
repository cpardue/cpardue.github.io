10.10.10.220
ran nmap -sV -p- -A -T5 -oN /path/file --script=vuln ipAddress  
i'm so used to rushing at work, this is painstakingly slow  
ports 22, 5080 open  
visited 5080 in browser, is a GitLab CE page  
hitting it with gobuster for seclinsts raft-large files and directories  
@exploit-db, looked up gitlab:  
lots of potential exploits  
candidate: CVE 2013-4490 Gitlab-shell - Code Execution (Metasploit)  
copied exploit to this folder with searchsploit, reviewed  
looks like it relies on gitlab using ssh keys in system calls  
needs valid creds first  
exploring http more while fuzzing runs:  
/root/ goes to administrator activity feed
/root/ Administrator is @root    
/help/ goes to help pages actually hosted on this machine  
/public/ yields repo n2/JDmvHSOF
/public/ username is @n2  
cannot sign in with n2::JDmvHSOF  
/search/ is a search page, INTERESTING  
/robots.txt yields a lot of INTERESTING rules  
/robots.txt there's a 1 sec rate limit so my fuzzing is nill  
/test/ yields another @test user, no activity  
looking back over /robots.txt  
searching google for gitlab issues  
found some arb file read from hackerone  
@hackerone: can read arb file by copy malformed issue from one project issue to another  
registered and logged into machine gitlab as n3  
created project n3/some-crap  
INTERESTING: this gitlab is in 172.19.0.2 container  
created project n3/some-other-crap  
created issue in some-other-crap  
moved issue to some-crap  
error occured while moving the issue  
did not move, did not copy the file out  
i need to know exact gitlab version  
vers 11.4.7 CE  
oh liveoverflow wrote about an RCE for this  
https://liveoverflow.com/gitlab-11-4-7-remote-code-execution-real-world-ctf-2018/  
found exploit edb-id 49334 gitlab 11.4.7 RCE  
updated searchsploit (-u)  
cancelled still-running fuzz  
n3 user creds are: cpardue@gmail.com::P9GWvfJbdK2ypMw  
searchsploit done updating, still no 49334  
downloaded 49334.py and moved to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/ruby/webapps/  
updated db (updatedb)  
started msfconsole  
no 49334 found  
followed a few guides on importing metasploit modules  
wow none worked  
this is a huge pain, tried 5 methods so far  
-------break------  
returned the next day  
have realized that i am an idiot, this is a python script, not ruby  
started machine back up  
machine responds to pings again  
reviewing pythong exploit  
flags are -u gitlabuser -p gitlabpass -g url -l localIP -p localPort  
created netcat listener on 1234  
re-registered user at target gitlab, htbuser::htbuser1234  
test ran exploit against machine 
output: creating project 'project1612'   
output: exploit completed successfully  
watching listener...nothing yet  
maybe it reached back out and couldn't touch my machine  
re-checked tun0 IP, is correct  
re-checked given port, is correct  
hmm  
logged in as the new htbuser, viewed projects  
project1612 import still underway  
INTERESTING: there's also a dude/ready-channel.git  
i wonder if i need to offer the container IP 172dot instead of 10dot  
maybe not, the exploit DID create the repo 
looking through /ready-channel.git  
lots and lots of files  
some scripts in /ready-channel/scripts  
INTERESTING: /ready-channel/web.config  
this file contains rules that i can perhaps edit out  
back to exploits  
found https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49263 to test  
it's from the liveoverflow article i was reading yesterday  
kids are going nuts and need to be put to bed
