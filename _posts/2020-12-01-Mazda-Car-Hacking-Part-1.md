My Kia Soul was recently totaled out.  I got a loan and picked a car.  The car: 2016.5 Mazda CX-5.  After purchasing said car from Carvana, I decided to look into its features.  Naturally, my google-fu steered me to some links about Mazda Infotainment hacking.  Most notably: [This video of a guy popping a shell with a backdoor][1] and [this repo of a developed set of tweaks exploiting a known JCI vulnerability][2].  
 <br>
 <br>
## Summary: 
<br>
Apparently, I can not only gain a root shell but also output scripts which tweak the UI (which I can likely just review and tweak even further).  
<br>
After receiving the car from Carvana, I checked the onboard firmware version and it is vulnerable.  
<br>
I am now driving the car for a few days to get a feel for everything.  
<br>
In the distant future I'd like to see if I can leverage cronjobs and packages to wardrive, or do a PoC mitm from the car itself.  
<br>
Hell maybe I could jump to installing routersploit and dump results of autopwn run from within open APs around town.  
<br>
Who knows.  
<br>
Start small.  
<br>
<br>
# Next Steps: 
<br>
-Find down time
<br>
-Enter JCI Test Mode to gain root shell and poke around
<br>
-Generate MZD-AIO tweaks, install, test
