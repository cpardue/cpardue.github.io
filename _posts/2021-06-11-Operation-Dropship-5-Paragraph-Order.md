## Operation Dropship  
### 5 Paragraph Order  
### Orientation  
I'm building an online store to house things I would have bought years ago.  
### Situation  
I have enough income to support an online store.  
I have performed recon and identified key components necessary to complete this task.  
### Mission  
Build out an online store.  
Link it in a few places.  
Perform SEO for self-support.  
### Execution  
In July, perform the following tasks:  
Purchase domain.  
Purchase Wix Business account.  
Build Wix site.  
Link Modalyst account to Wix account.  
Finalize initial product listings.  
Populate store with products.  
Tweak store design.  
Go live.  
### Administration  
Domain should be a tongue in cheek reference to IT or script kiddies.  
### Logistics  
Domain ending in .io is $60/yr flat rate.  
Domain ending in .com can be as low as $12/yr flat rate.  
Wix Business account appears to be $27/mo.  
Modalyst hobby account is free.  
Website colors should match either personal mechanical keyboard, or the skull graphic I hacked into my car's touchscreen.
