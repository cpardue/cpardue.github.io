<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="3">I haven’t posted really since I started my new job last month.<br>
Every day for 8hrs straight I have been studying various aspects of Email Security.<br>
Because of this, I have decided to do a hard stop on evening studying, lest my brain revolt.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="6">After studying in the evenings for years now, making myself perform a hard stop and just enjoy<br>
my evenings has been difficult.  As soon as I re-learn to be still, it will be time to re-learn how to get back to the grind.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="17">In this time I have:<br>
-Built a brand new mechanical keyboard.<br>
-Purchased and set up a public domain for this site (<a href="http://chris-pardue.com">chris-pardue.com</a>).<br>
-Secured that domain with SSL, compression, and forwarding instead of masking (<a href="http://chris-pardue.com">chris-pardue.com</a> -&gt; https:// -&gt; <a href="http://cpardue.github.io">cpardue.github.io</a>).<br>
-Insisted on re-setting up a lab domain (I feel bad about my esxi host wasting away for days at a time).<br>
I will probably set up masking once I have proven to myself that I am fine with the SSL cert.<br>
I will probably begin migrating this blog into a different third-party hosted website so that I can integrate things.<br>
I will probably post about the keyboard, since I need blog content about at least a few non-cybersecurity things.<br>
I will probably dump a bunch of notes about an email spammer which I have been OSINT-ing for a co-worker.<br>
I SHOULD start pumping out my non-confidential notes as posts.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="19" data-line-end="20">That’s it, I just wanted to bridge the gap between the flurry of posts, the hard stop (which is now), and the continuing flurry of posts (once I’m comfortable with new worklife balance).</p>
