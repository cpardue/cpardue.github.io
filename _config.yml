title_description: "My name is Chris Pardue.  I want to grow up to be a pentester.  I'm a Security Engineer by trade.  I want to unlock the rank of Offensive Security Certified Professional so I am grinding for experience points.  Hopefully, by 2025 or so, this blog will have so much crap in it that a hiring manager will just look at it once and say 'Yep ok he knows his stuff.'  The icons below link directly to my Twitter, Linkedin, HackTheBox, Github, and Reddit profiles."
