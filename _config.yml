title_description: "My name is Chris Pardue, and I am an professional.  I don't like IT per se, I do dislike Windows greatly, but I like the Cybersecurity realm quite a bit.  I am presently working my way through a few years of Sysadmin, Netadmin experience to build a firm foundation for SOC work, then the real goal, Penetration Testing.  This is a place to start building my porfolio of work done and experience gained.  Think of this blog as an extension of my resume.  Feel free to explore my notes via the search function."
